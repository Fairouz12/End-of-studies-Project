# End-of-studies-Project

# Introduction
This project is a chatbot service client developed as part of my final year project. The chatbot is built using Rasa and NLP techniques and is designed to provide customer service support. This agent caters to customer needs regarding mobile internet packages, including inquiries about renewal, pricing, validity, etc. It also provides information related to customer accounts, such as balance verification and bonus tracking.Additionally, we integrated our conversational agent into a Flask application as the user interface.

# Installation and configuration : 
Follow these simple steps:

- Install Rasa by following the instructions at Rasa Installation and Setup.  https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/

- Create a project_directory for your project.
- Initialize Rasa within your project_directory by running the command rasa init.
- Replace the files in the project_directory with the ones from the downloaded template.
- Train the bot using the command rasa train.
- Evaluate the bot in the terminal with the command rasa test.

OPTIONAL: If you find a file called actions.py in your template directory, run the command rasa run actions in a new terminal.
Start talking to the bot in the terminal using the command rasa shell.

## Here are a few examples of conversations between the chatbot user and the chatbot :
